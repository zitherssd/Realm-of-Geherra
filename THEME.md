# THEME

## High-Level Theme Statement

**The world is ancient, cyclical, and indifferent.**

Civilizations rise not toward progress, but toward *inevitable imbalance*. War is not chaos—it is a corrective force. Cultures are shaped by myth, environment, and fatalistic belief systems that predate written history. Nothing is modern. Nothing is accidental.

This theme should guide **all content generation**, including narrative text, dialogue, faction behavior, unit design, item descriptions, events, and AI-authored flavor.

---

## Core Pillars of the Ancient Theme

### 1. Myth Over History

* Events are remembered as **symbols**, not facts
* Legends matter more than timelines
* Characters speak in absolutes, omens, and inherited belief

When generating content:

* Prefer mythic explanations over logical ones
* Avoid precise dates, measurements, or modern causality

---

### 2. Cycles, Not Progress

* Time is circular, not linear
* Collapse is expected and often welcomed
* Advancement is viewed with suspicion

When generating content:

* Frame victories as temporary
* Frame defeat as *inevitable or necessary*
* Avoid language implying permanent improvement

---

### 3. Cultural Fatalism

Every faction believes:

* The world is **ending incorrectly**
* Their way is the *least wrong* way
* Others are misguided, not evil

No faction sees itself as modern or enlightened.

---

## Racial / Cultural Hierarchy

### The Menari

*The Common Stock*

* The most widespread people
* Fragmented into countless cultures, city-states, and traditions
* No unified identity beyond mythic ancestry
* Form the bulk of armies, labor, rulers, and victims of history

The Menari endure through adaptation, forgetting, and rebuilding.

> "The Menari endure because they do not remember clearly."

---

### The Dacians

*The Rival Heirs*

* Less common than the Menari
* Strong cultural memory and shared identity
* Often in direct rivalry or tension with Menari civilizations
* Define themselves in opposition to Menari dominance

Where the Menari fragment, the Dacians persist.
Where the Menari adapt, the Dacians resist.

Their rivalry is ancestral rather than ideological.

> "They were us once. That is why we cannot forgive them."

---

### The Hyperboreans

*The Elevated Few*

* Extremely rare
* Not part of the Menari–Dacian continuum
* Viewed as mythic, semi-divine, or anachronistic
* Operate according to principles alien to common peoples

The Hyperboreans do not compete for land or power.
They intervene when balance is broken.

> "They arrive only when something has gone wrong."

---

## Relationship Dynamics

* **Menari ↔ Dacians**: Rivalry, resentment, inherited conflict
* **Menari ↔ Hyperboreans**: Fear, awe, and misinterpretation
* **Dacians ↔ Hyperboreans**: Respect tempered by defiance

---

## Faction Tone Guidelines

### Hyperboreans (Example Reference)

* Calm, distant, ritualistic
* Violence is corrective, not emotional
* Language is formal, sparse, and absolute

Preferred language:

* "Balance"
* "Correction"
* "The Sun wills"
* "It is time"

Avoid:

* Taunts
* Humor
* Emotional outbursts

---

### (Other Factions)

Each faction should:

* Believe in a **cosmic or ancestral justification**
* Have taboos that override logic
* Treat war as sacred, cursed, or inevitable

---

## Sacred Timekeeping

Time is not measured mechanically. It is **named, ritualized, and culturally weighted**.

### Named Time Periods (Canonical)

* **Stilldark** (0–3) — Absolute quiet, omens strongest
* **Lowlight** (3–6) — The world stirs, spirits withdraw
* **Firstlight** (6–9) — Oaths, beginnings, judgments
* **Highsun** (9–12) — Labor, travel, open war
* **Suncrest** (12–15) — Authority, ritual proclamations
* **Falling Sun** (15–18) — Reckoning, duels, consequences
* **Dusktide** (18–21) — Memory, mourning, preparation
* **Gloamhour** (21–24) — Secrets, betrayal, forbidden acts

When generating content:

* Refer to time **by name**, not by hour
* Certain actions are culturally forbidden or empowered depending on the period

---

## Skills as Cultural Practices

Skills are not abstract mechanics. They are **ritualized human behaviors** passed down through generations.

Skills range from **0 (Uninitiated)** to **5 (Ancestral Mastery)**.

### Canonical Skill Interpretations

* **Tracking** — Reading the land’s memory through footprints, bent grass, blood
* **Shadowcraft** — Silent movement, ambush, ritual killing, concealment
* **Divination** — Interpreting the will of gods through sacrifice and signs

  * Accepted methods include **hepatoscopy** and **extispicy**
* **Engineering** — Stonework, siegecraft, ritual construction
* **Oratory** — Binding speech: negotiation, deception, command before witnesses
* **Command / Leadership** — Authority recognized by omen, lineage, or victory
* **Navigation / Pathfinding** — Reading stars, wind, landmarks, and mythic routes
* **Foraging** — Knowing what the land allows to be taken without offense

When generating skills or checks:

* Frame success as *permission granted*, not competence alone
* Frame failure as taboo, misreading, or divine refusal

---

## Antiquity Doctrine (Plato / Solon Reference)

The world is **older than memory allows**.

Civilizations have risen and been erased many times. What remains is fragmentary, mythologized, and incomplete. Writing does not preserve truth—**it erodes it**.

Knowledge is:

* Inherited, not discovered
* Remembered imperfectly
* Often misunderstood by later peoples

When generating lore or exposition:

* Imply that current cultures are survivors, not founders
* Treat "ancient" ruins as recent echoes of far older worlds
* Avoid presenting any faction as the first or greatest

---

## Language & Dialogue Rules

When generating dialogue, text, or flavor:

DO:

* Use declarative, confident statements
* Reference ancestors, gods, cycles, or omens
* Speak as if knowledge is inherited, not discovered

AVOID:

* Modern phrasing
* Casual humor (unless culturally justified)
* Meta-awareness or self-reflection

Example:

> "This land has already chosen its dead. We are merely arriving on time."

---

## Violence & Conflict Framing

Violence is:

* Ritualistic
* Symbolic
* Rarely celebrated

Battles are not framed as good vs evil, but as:

* Correction vs excess
* Order vs imbalance
* Tradition vs decay

---

## AI Content Generation Guidance

When using AI systems to generate:

### Dialogue

* Short, weighty lines
* Minimal exposition
* No modern idioms

### Unit Names

* Derived from myth, environment, or ritual
* Avoid generic fantasy terms

### Events

* Triggered by imbalance, omens, or excess
* Resolved through sacrifice, war, or withdrawal

### Descriptions

* Evoke age, inevitability, and restraint
* Focus on *meaning*, not function

---

## Emotional Palette

Primary:

* Solemn
* Resolute
* Alien
* Reverent

Secondary:

* Melancholic
* Foreboding
* Quietly hostile

Avoid:

* Whimsy
* Satire
* Modern irony

---

## Final Rule

If a piece of generated content could exist in a modern setting **without modification**, it does not fit the theme.

Time must feel named. Skills must feel ritualized. Knowledge must feel inherited.

Everything should feel:

* Old beyond memory
* Certain of its purpose
* Unconcerned with the future

---

*This document is a thematic constraint. When in doubt, favor age, myth, and inevitability over clarity or convenience.*
